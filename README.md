This mod is based on the popular Forge Mod [Towers of the Wild](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/towers-of-the-wild), 
so all credits go to the original Author [idrae_](https://www.curseforge.com/members/idrae_).

We really wanted to use this mod on 1.17+ so we decided to port it.
Because of some other compatibilities we choose the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and now, here we are! :)

Have fun using this mod!

This mod adds tall towers in your world, inspired by **The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild**.

This will make your explorations a bit more exciting !

At the top of the tower *(which is purposely not so easy to climb)*, you will find a chest with some loot, as well as a nice view :)

The mod is compatible with every world gen / structure mod.

Plus, it is also compatible with the [Waystones (Fabric Edition)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones-fabric) and [Fabric Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-waystones) mod. If you have one of these mods installed a waystone will spawn on top of each tower.

This mod does not add any blocks or items to the game (if that matters to you).

### Features
* Randomly generating Towers in your world
* Great loot on top of every Tower!
* If [Waystones (Fabric Edition)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones-fabric) or [Fabric Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-waystones) mod is active, waystones can spawn on top of each tower!
  * **Only install one of them!**
* Multiple Tower types *(derelict, derelict_grass, ice, jungle, ocean, ocean_warm, regular)*
* Advancements for every tower *(Can you climb all of them?)*

## How to install
**Prerequisite:**
* Minecraft 1.18.1
* [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
* [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) inside `.minecraft/mods`
* [Cloth Config API (Fabric)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) inside `.minecraft/mods`

Simply put the file `towers_of_the_wild-*.jar` inside you mods directory.

**Note:**
If you also want to use [Waystones (Fabric Edition)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones-fabric) you'll also need the [Balm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balm-fabric) mod.

## How to configure
The mod generates the file `.minecraft/config/towers_of_the_wild_reworked.json`.

There you can set a multiple of things:
* Should the tower type be active?
* What should be the spacing *(in chunks)*?
* What should be the separation *(in chunks)*?
* Do you want Waystones on top of towers?
* Some debugging stuff

### !!! Important !!! <!-- omit in toc -->
The spacing has to be higher than the separation!
